## <center><span style="color: #FF70A6;">ABOUT</span></center>

Ahnjili is a New York-born, Hong Kong-raised, Netherlands-based data scientist, Ph.D. candidate, artist, and science communicator. Ahnjili’s academic research focuses on developing smartphone- and wearables-based biomarkers that can be used to monitor one’s mental and physical wellbeing for clinical trials. Ahnjili’s artistic research and science communication focuses on educating the public about A.I. and algorithmic violence, which refers to the violence that is justified or created by an automated decision-making system. Her projects have previously focused on investigating the correlation between hormonal cycles and internet patterns, developing a predictive policing system to predict police brutality, and creating fashion police drones.

Ahnjili also has an interest in the influence of psychedelic drugs on cognition and lifestyle. She completed her Cognitive Neuroscience MSc at Radboud University (Netherlands), where her master’s thesis focused on the effects of mindfulness, Ritalin, and LSD on cognitive flexibility. Since then she has continued to do quantitative and qualitative research on recreational drug use with the Global Drug Survey and Quantified Citizen.

## PROJECTS

| 2022 -     | SHIBBOLETH: CREATION OF A HYBRID VOICE |
|---|------------|
| | Effi & Amir, | 
| | Brussels, Belgium |

> We produced a ‘dual voice’ - that transforms fluidly from a recognizable voice of Speaker A to a voice of a Speaker B while speaking. With the "switch" happening at points of sonic uncertainty in the voice output, where a certain articulation or tonal quality could belong to either speaker. The generated algorithm was used in the ‘The 8th Letter’ theater performance of Effi and Amir (November 2022/ **[https://effiandamir.net/index.php?id=538](https://effiandamir.net/index.php?id=538)**).

## EXHIBITIONS


| 2024 -     | NEW MEDIA ART CONFERENCE |
|---|------------|
| | CICA Museum, Seoul, Republic of Korea |



> Fashion Police Drones In June 2024 at the CICA Museum, the Fashion Police Drone installation will be presented at the New Media Arts Conference in Korea. The Fashion Police Drones, armed with custom fashion recognition algorithms, will track individuals based on audience-defined criteria for "fashion crimes". Through this interactive experience, the exhibition challenges conventional perspectives about drone and AI applications, sparking discussions about the evolving landscape of surveillance and the ethical use of AI-driven technologies in our contemporary world. I aim to trigger the audience’s curiosity about the boundaries of surveillance, the potential consequences of automation in military application and law enforcement, and the societal implications of cultural profiling.

 | 2023 -     | VOICES |
|---|------------|
|  | IMPAKT festival, Utrecht, Netherlands |

> VOICES, an interactive installation, invites participants to co-create a sound-art composition with their voice. Participants are asked to record a secret. In return, they can be visually guided through the processing, analysis, and cloning of their voice recordings by various Machine Listening algorithms, and can experience a sound-art composition in which their voice narrates the secrets of others. This immersive experience aims to shed light on the otherwise opaque inner workings of machine listening. VOICES COLLECTIVE has been granted “the European Festivals Fund for Emerging Artists”. This grant, coupled with the support from IMPAKT, has enabled to bring the VOICES installation to life with an exhibition at ARS ELECTRONICA 2023.

  | 2023 -     | Articulating Data |
|---|------------|
|  | Edinburgh, United Kingdom |

> Babble-on is a web-based installation allowing users to create personalized babble tapes by recording 2-3 sentences into a microphone. The audio is sliced and remixed to maintain the same audio properties of their voices. Users can download their tapes to disguise their conversations from audio surveillance. Presented at the Articulating Data conference 2023.

  | 2021 -     | This Machine Is Black |
|---|------------|
|  | Identity 2.0, London, United Kingdom |

> This exhibition explored how Afrofuturism can be used to remove (or at least alleviate) the normative pressure that AI puts on non-normative bodies. Although with a few exceptions, the black experience has largely been invisible in AI datasets. I trained a series of generative AI algorithms on Afrofuturistic datasets to envision the future of the Afrofuturism aesthetic. **[www.identity20.org/thismachineisblack/](www.identity20.org/thismachineisblack/)**

|  | ANAÏS BERCK: AN ALGOLITERARY PUBLISHING HOUSE, Belgium |

> During the residency we developed algoliterary publications. These are publishing experiments with algorithms and literary, scientific, and activist datasets about trees and nature. We ask ourselves: who and what is excluded, made invisible or exploited in the existent representations, discourses, tools, and practices? To address these questions, we used decision tree algorithms to sort the histories of tree nomenclature. **[algoliterarypublishing.net/](algoliterarypublishing.net/)**

## COMMISSIONS

 | 2023 -     | DIGITAL PIONEERS: A VISIONARY PRELUDE |
|---|------------|
|  | Stichting Impakt |
|  | Utrecht, Netherlands |

> "Digital Pioneers: A Visionary Prelude" is a digital artwork that blends technology and art, creating a cheeky introduction to the IMPAKT festival 2023. This piece features deepfake representations of three prominent tech CEOs, not as mere figures of authority, but as digital orators guiding the audience through the evolving landscape of technology and art. Each CEO's deepfake delivers a segment of the festival's introduction, focusing on themes closely aligned with their real-world contributions and visions. The first segment delves into the transformative power of technology in art, emphasizing innovation and the breaking of traditional boundaries. The second part addresses the ethical considerations and societal impacts of tech advancements, encouraging viewers to ponder the responsibilities that come with innovation. The final segment looks to the future, inspiring a dialogue about the potential of technology in shaping new forms of artistic expression. The artwork is not just a visual spectacle but an auditory experience as well. The deepfakes' voices have been modulated to create a harmonious symphony, symbolizing the unity and collaborative potential within the tech and art communities. "Digital Pioneers" does more than just introduce a festival; it stands as a testament to the ever-blurring lines between human creativity and technological prowess, inviting viewers to explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of art and technology. **[http://www.impaktfestival.nl/]([algoliterarypublishing.net/](http://www.impaktfestival.nl/)http://www.impaktfestival.nl/)**
