| | Text from [Kurina Sohn's website](https://kurinasohn.com/deepest-unknown-v1.html) |
| | Deepest Unknown v.1 is an artistic collaboration with AI, generating speculative stories and images that illuminate the mysteries and potential losses of remote underwater environments. The project envision life beyond our limitations while exploring our connection with water and the ecological consequences of human actions. Through digital tools and mechanical techniques, the project transports viewers into alternative realities, expanding our comprehension of deep ocean ecologies. The analysis of individual sea creatures prompts a reassessment of our relationship with water and recognizes technology's impact on our perception of nature.
| | Deepest Unknown installation v.1 engaged the audience through a mix of graphic videos and deep-sea soundscapes. The video featured a creature created using customized StabelDiffusion AI, incorporating a deep-sea dataset and marine debris images. The storytelling aspect involved a dialogue with GPT-2, where human prompts were displayed in italics and the AI-generated script in bold. The physical space featured a DALL:E2 AI-designed zero-gravity chair and a diagram illustrating the various ways we experience nature, encouraging visitors to reflect on our relationship with the natural world.|
| |  Deepest Unknown is realised by collaboration with Ahnjili Zhuparris (Customising StableDiffusion AI), Colette Aliman (Deep-sea soundscape design), Tiiu Meiner (Co-writing GPT-2 video script), Tivon Rice (‘models for environmental literacy’ GPT-2 dataset), Taegwon Bae(Film Art Directing , 3D Art), Changju Yoon(UnrealEngine engineering), Seungmin Lee(film editing, VFX post processing), YoungJae Nah(animator), and Marsha van Leersum(Assistant).   |

| |  |
|  | During the residency we developed algoliterary publications. These are publishing experiments with algorithms and literary, scientific, and activist datasets about trees and nature. We ask ourselves: who and what is excluded, made invisible or exploited in the existent representations, discourses, tools, and practices? To address these questions, we used decision tree algorithms to sort the histories of tree nomenclature.  |

| 2024 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| Screen-to-Soundscape/Techno Disobedience |
|---|------------|
|  | Constant, The Processing Foundation, The Simulerings Fonds |
|  | Belgium, USA, Netherlands |
| |  |
|  | Screen-to-Soundscape adopts a creative and experimental approach to reimagining screen reader voices. The project aims to develop a speculative design prototype that transforms a browser or screen into an immersive soundscape. This prototype will feature multiple layered voices reading all readable text in unison with spatial audio enabling users to discern the text's location within the browser. The motivation behind this initiative is to overcome the inherent limitations of traditional screen readers by offering users with visual impairments a more intuitive and immersive way to navigate digital content. This not only benefits users with visual impairments but also provides a richer, more engaging web experience for all users. This project was supported by Constant, the Processing Foundation, and the Stimulerings Fonds. |

| |  |
|  | "Digital Pioneers: A Visionary Prelude" is a digital artwork that blends technology and art, creating a cheeky introduction to the IMPAKT festival 2023. This piece features deepfake representations of three prominent tech CEOs, not as mere figures of authority, but as digital orators guiding the audience through the evolving landscape of technology and art. Each CEO's deepfake delivers a segment of the festival's introduction, focusing on themes closely aligned with their real-world contributions and visions. The first segment delves into the transformative power of technology in art, emphasizing innovation and the breaking of traditional boundaries. The second part addresses the ethical considerations and societal impacts of tech advancements, encouraging viewers to ponder the responsibilities that come with innovation. The final segment looks to the future, inspiring a dialogue about the potential of technology in shaping new forms of artistic expression. The artwork is not just a visual spectacle but an auditory experience as well. The deepfakes' voices have been modulated to create a harmonious symphony, symbolizing the unity and collaborative potential within the tech and art communities. "Digital Pioneers" does more than just introduce a festival; it stands as a testament to the ever-blurring lines between human creativity and technological prowess, inviting viewers to explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of art and technology. |

|---|------------|
|  | Book |
|  | Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press |
|  | Wevers, R Edited by Ponzanesi, S. and Leurs, Koen. |
|  | Amsterdam, Netherlands |
|  |  |
| |  This chapter discusses the artistic project Future Wake (2021) by Ahnjili Zhuparris and Tim van Ommeren that examines predictive policing. By shifting the focus from possible future crime offenders to possible future victims of fatal police encounters, using visual and affective means rather than expert knowledge and statistics, the artwork activates critical reflection on the politics and logics of predictive policing systems. The chapter first situates predictive policing in a context of securitization, and discusses how it enhances structures of discrimination. In the second part, Wevers interviews artist Zhuparris about the aims of Future Wake, discussing the artistic and technical process of creating the project, the politics of data, and the role of art in critical discussion on surveillance and AI.|
