This is a demo post. It is a simple markdown file that contains a YAML front matter block at the top. The front matter block contains metadata about the post, such as the title and layout. The rest of the file is written in markdown, which is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read and write. Markdown is often used to write documentation and is supported by many static site generators, including Jekyll.
