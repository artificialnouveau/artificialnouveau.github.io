By pitting two algorithms against another, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used to create images and text convincing enough to fool the human eye and mind. GANs have made computer graphics come alive and given artists new tools for experimentation. You may have seen GANs used to generate photographs of human faces,create realistic images of cats based on sketches, or write a new bible.

In this workshop, youâ€™ll learn about how to use and customize GANS for text-to-text generation, text-to-image generation, and image-to-image generation. No coding experience is necessary, as Ahnjili will be providing you with Python code to play with your own GANs.
