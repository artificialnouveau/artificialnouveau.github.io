SHIBBOLETH: CREATION OF A HYBRID VOICE 

Together with Effi & Amir and Jonathan Reus, we produced a ‘dual voice’ - that transforms fluidly from a recognizable voice of Speaker A to a voice of a Speaker B while speaking. With the "switch" happening at points of sonic uncertainty in the voice output, where a certain articulation or tonal quality could belong to either speaker. The generated algorithm was used in the ‘(The 8th Letter)[https://effiandamir.net/index.php?id=538]’ theater performance of Effi and Amir (in November 2022).
