excerpt: "An interactive data visualization that maps psychoactive drug experiences to animated flowers. Each flower encodes pharmacological properties through its petals, color, shape, sway, and bloom cycle."
---

Flowers is an interactive data visualization that transforms the subjective experience of psychoactive substances into animated botanical forms. Each flower represents a drug's full experience timeline — from onset through come-up, peak, offset, and after-effects — compressed into a real-time animation.

## How It Works

Every visual property of a flower maps to a pharmacological characteristic:

- **Petals** encode cognitive complexity — more petals mean a richer, more layered headspace with distinct thought patterns and altered perceptions
- **Shape** represents drug class — rounded for depressants/entactogens, pointed for stimulants, wavy for psychedelics, wispy for dissociatives, trumpet for deliriants, serrated leaf for cannabinoids
- **Color** follows drug class — warm reds/yellows for stimulants, cool blues for depressants, purples/greens for psychedelics, grays for dissociatives
- **Size** reflects intensity
- **Sway** indicates body load — heavier sway means more physical effects
- **Center** visualizes ego dissolution — during peak, the center expands outward and its boundaries dissolve into soft rings as the sense of self dissolves
- **Stem** represents total duration
- **Glow** marks the peak phase
- **Background** shows hallucination intensity with class-specific visual effects

## Features

- **Solo view**: Click any flower to watch its full timeline with phase indicators, hallucination backgrounds, and generative audio
- **Compare mode**: Place two flowers side-by-side to see how their timelines and effects differ, with documented pharmacological interaction data and a hybrid flower showing the predicted combined experience
- **Dose scaling**: Adjust dose from low to high and watch the flower respond in real-time
- **Generative audio**: Each drug class has unique timbres — resonant harmonics for psychedelics, hollow metallic for dissociatives, percussive for stimulants, warm bass for depressants
- **100+ substances** sourced from PsychonautWiki's evidence-based data
