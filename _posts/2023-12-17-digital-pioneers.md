Each CEO's deepfake delivers a segment of the festival's introduction, focusing on themes closely aligned with their real-world contributions and visions. The first segment delves into the transformative power of technology in art, emphasizing innovation and the breaking of traditional boundaries. The second part addresses the ethical considerations and societal impacts of tech advancements, encouraging viewers to ponder the responsibilities that come with innovation. The final segment looks to the future, inspiring a dialogue about the potential of technology in shaping new forms of artistic expression.
