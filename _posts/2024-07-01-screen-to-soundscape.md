Screen-to-Soundscape adopts an experimental approach to re-imaging screen readers, by addressing the current limitations for blind and visually impaired users. Our goal is to develop a free and open-source explorative tool that transforms a screen into an immersive soundscape, with a strong focus on providing rich, descriptive alt-text for images and maps. Using open-source computer vision algorithms, our system will analyze visual elements to generate detailed and customizable alt-text tailored to user preferences, offering a more comprehensive understanding of visual content. Additionally, the prototype will feature spatial audio, using multiple layered voices to read out the content, which ideally would enhance the users' navigation and interaction with digital content.

Our motivation is to provide a more intuitive and engaging navigation experience. Traditional screen readers often skip images, videos, and maps, and offer limited customization, especially in voice diversity. By incorporating spatial audio, novel computer vision algorithms, diverse voice options, and a customizable alt-text tool, our tool ensures all content is accessible and allows users to personalize their auditory experience, making digital navigation more natural and comprehensive.

Screen-to-Soundscape is supported by the Constant Foundation, The Processing Foundation, and the Stimuleringsfonds.
