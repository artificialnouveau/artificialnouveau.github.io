DEEPFAKE examines the cultural and emotional impact of this emerging synthetic media. From AI-powered memorials to non-consensual pornography, it unpacks this novel digital frontier where likenesses are stolen, realities are rewritten, and consent is often an afterthought. DEEPFAKE confronts a future already in motion, where our bodies are no longer private, but programmable.
Presented alongside a live installation featuring real-time deepfake technology, the work invites viewers to witness their own digital identity manipulated before their eyes.
