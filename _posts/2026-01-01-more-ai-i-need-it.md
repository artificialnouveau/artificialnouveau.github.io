MORE AI! I NEED IT! PLEASE! is a satirical catalog of the most absurd, questionable, and bewilderingly real AI products flooding the market. Part consumer guide, part cultural critique, it documents a world where artificial intelligence has been shoehorned into every conceivable corner of human existence — from ice makers with "AI NoiseGuard" to $175,000 animatronic companions.

The project is organized into three sections: **AI Automation**, cataloging smart devices that nobody asked for (including McDonald's ill-fated AI drive-thru and a spoon that mildly electrocutes you); **AI Companions**, featuring products designed to fill the void of human connection with silicon and subscriptions (a necklace that eavesdrops on you 24/7, holographic anime girlfriends with eye-tracking, and AI dolls for the elderly); and **Specialized Therapists**, a collection of "expert" AI services ranging from an AI Jesus Confessional installed in a Swiss church to a cat translator with 22 million downloads.

The site features interactive elements including tiered pricing models, a usefulness-vs-desirability rating chart, a mystery box that randomly assigns you an AI service, and a customer review submission system — all presented with the same slick marketing language these products use to sell themselves.

MORE AI! I NEED IT! PLEASE! holds up a mirror to AI hype culture, letting the products speak for themselves. When a $699 AI pin gets universally panned and a "robot lawyer" gets fined by the FTC, the satire practically writes itself.
