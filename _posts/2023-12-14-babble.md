BabbleOn is an interactive web installation allowing users to craft their own 'babble tapes'â€” digital audio designed to thwart audio surveillance. These tapes, blending indistinct human speech, effectively mask conversations by mimicking their acoustic qualities. Despite evolving multi-speaker identification technologies, BabbleOn provides a unique experience: participants record a few sentences, which are then mixed into a customized babble tape, infused with the distinct properties of their own voice. Participants can download these tapes, offering a personal tool against future audio surveillance.
