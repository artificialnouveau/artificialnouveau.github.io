In the Algorithmic Art Demo with Processing workshop, we focus on making coding approachable for everyone, especially for those who are curious about blending art with technology. We use Processing because itâ€™s a straightforward way to get into coding. The workshop is all about hands-on learning, where participants get to play with code and see how it can turn into visual pieces right before their eyes. My main aim is to get people comfortable with the idea of coding and to show that it can be a fun tool for creative expression. It's pretty much for anyone interested in giving coding a go, using art as a fun entry point.
